### Goal

The goal of storage is to create a common api for storing and retrieving files and data from various locations and services using familiar patterns found in [templates][] and applications that inherit [templates][] like [assemble][], [verb][], and [generate][].

Storage allows adding [providers](#providers), which are similar to [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates#engines), but they're used for file system and database storage.

### Providers

Providers create a common interface for file system and database storage. This may include direct file system storage with the [fs]() module, Amazon S3 access with the node [s3]() module, database storage through JSON files, leveldb, mongodb, or custom rest endpoints with your own module.

To support the widest range of modules, all interface methods will be async (since sync may still be accomplished) and should handle returning an `err` object, when an error occurs, and a `results` object when appropriate.

Providers should also be inherited from [base-provider][] to allow plugin usage and common methods.

The following methods should be implemented by default or through plugins:

- **create** Creates a new collection (this will be called through the `storage.create` method using the specified provider)
- **collection#set** Sets a value on the specified collection.
- **collection#get** Gets a value from the specified collection.
- **collection#del** Deletes a value from the specified collection.
- **collection#find** Finds a list of values from the specified collection

Optionally, the following methods may be implemented by default or through plugins:

- **collection#index** Creates an index on the collection that may be used in `find` methods.
- **collection#byIndex** Uses an index to find items on the collection.
